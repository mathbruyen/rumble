### Background

This is a simple game that I realized for [that competition](http://www.web-tambouille.fr/2012/03/24/un-pass-3-jours-pour-devoxx-france-a-gagner-sur-web-tambouille-concours.html).
Not very advanced graphically, I tried more to add a dynamic feature with badges (though there are not enought of them).

### How to play

1. Go to [the deployed game](http://proto-rumble.mais-h.eu/)
2. Choose a username and enter the game
3. At each round, select a number either by clicking on the cell or by entering the value in the input
4. Earn badges while playing (or not)

### Ideas/TODOs

* new badges
** win n rounds in arow
** all cells filled by other players before you could play
** filled the last available cell
* use a datalist to suggest values to enter in the input
* add spinners
* adapt grid size to number of players
* players with avatars
* show badges of other players
